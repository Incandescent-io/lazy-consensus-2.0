# Overview

Lazy Consensus 2.0 is a revision of Lazy Consensus, where a consensus is assumed to be obtained unless objections are explicitly noted. Embodying a "speak now or forever hold you peace" mentality, Lazy Consensus 2.0 encourages action. 

## Background

Popularized by the [governance documentation of Apache Rave](https://rave.apache.org/docs/governance/lazyConsensus.html), Lazy Consensus asserts that "that when you are convinced that you know what the community would like to see happen you can simply assume that you already have consensus and get on with the work."

# Tenets

* the use of Lazy Consensus 2.0 must be declared and understood by the community
* transparency enables informed decisions
* the community understands the proposed changes and the underlying reasoning for them
* the execution of the change must align the intent of the change
* Lazy Consensus 2.0 is not a excuse for imperfect work, nor should it be used to trick a community into approving a given change
* common sense supercedes all: high risk changes should not use Lazy Consensus 2.0

# Process

* State intent and declare the use of Lazy Consensus 2.0
* Assume that you have approval and begin working on an increment
* Before integrating the increment with the consequential body of work (a main branch, for example), allow for the dissent period to lapse or to receive explicit indications of consent from all community members
* Commit changes and notify community

# Components
 
## Dissent Period

the determined timeframe where objections can be brought up before a change is made
  
### Best Practices

  * the dissent period should be proportionate to the size and impact of the change. 
  * the dissent period is dependent on the overall work structure, team norms, and community availability.
  
## Community
the group of individuals who have the awareness to render a decision, either affirmative or negative.

## Declaration
a statement indicating the use of Lazy Consensus 2.0 and the dissent period.
  
### Best Practices

* If Lazy Consensus 2.0 is not yet used or understood by the community, link to this page in the declaration
